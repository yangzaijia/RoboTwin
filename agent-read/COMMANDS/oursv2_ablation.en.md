# OursV2 Data-Count and GraspNet Ablations

## R: 1 Robot + 49 Ours

This experiment changes only the oursv2 data composition. Video generation, planner outputs, state/action layout, and Piper0515 conversion remain unchanged. Each task contains 49 ours episodes so one real-robot episode can be added for a 50-episode task.

Selection priority is accepted -> medium -> unreviewed -> bad. If fewer than 49 unique planner/Stage-2 outputs exist, the earliest accepted rows are repeated. Exact order and provenance are stored under:

Run:

~~~bash
tmux new-session -d -s oursv2_49ep_pipeline \
  'SKIP_UPLOAD=1 bash /home/zaijia001/ssd/RoboTwin/code_painting/run_oursv2_49ep_pipeline.sh'
~~~

gdrive:piper/multi/6task/robot_oursv2_piper0515_49ep
~~~

The final conversion updates both observation.state and action. In each Piper0515 arm base frame, +x is forward, +y is left, and +z is up. Current oursv2_piper0515 data is in the same workspace as the real robot. The older combined 300-episode repo still contains world-frame ours rows.

## S: GraspNet Top-Score Ablation

This uses the same 25 IDs, keyframes, right-wrist camera configuration, Stage-1/Stage-2, training conversion, and Piper0515 alignment as ours. The main changed variable is the highest AnyGrasp score among valid candidates for the expected object.

candidate_selection_mode=top_score_auto
candidate_max_rotation_distance_deg=-1
candidate_keep_camera_up=0
enforce_candidate_distance_constraint=0
~~~

Top-score selection does not use a hand-orientation threshold or hand-rotation tie-break. Expected-object matching remains enabled, while the candidate-distance threshold is disabled. Empty keyframes resolve to the nearest non-empty AnyGrasp frame.

tmux new-session -d -s graspnet_selected25_pipeline \

## Local Completion Status (2026-07-10)

- R: all six tasks contain 49 episodes and all six repositories include `piper0515_world_to_base_conversion.json`; the archive is 1.3 GB.
- S: all six tasks contain 25 episodes and all six repositories include `piper0515_world_to_base_conversion.json`; the archive is 351 MB.
- Both pipelines completed with `SKIP_UPLOAD=1`. The rclone destinations are documented, but no data has been exported to external Google Drive yet.

### Per-Arm 7D EE Action Schema

Each final LeRobot arm action is `[ee_x, ee_y, ee_z, ee_roll, ee_pitch, ee_yaw, gripper]`. RPY uses `xyz` Euler order in radians. Concatenating the two arms gives 14D `observation.state` and 14D `action`.

This differs from the planner-internal pose: a TCP pose in `pose_debug.jsonl` is `[x, y, z, qw, qx, qy, qz]`, with the gripper command stored separately. Before training-data export, the quaternion is converted to RPY and the gripper scalar is appended as the seventh per-arm value.
